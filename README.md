In this library, I'm continuing my personal diving into the world of synchronization 

[todo] (almost everything so far :) )

Library will consist of lock-free building blocks:
- Hazard Pointer (regular) ✅
- HP with Reference Count ⛔️
- HP (Pass-the-buck version) 🚧
- RCU (single writer) 🚧

And basic stuctures:
- Treiber Stack 🚧
- Michael-Scott Queue 🚧
- Lock-free HashMap ⛔️
- Lock-free SkipList ⛔️
- Parking Lot ⛔️
- Sequence Lock ⛔️
