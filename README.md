In this library, I'm continuing my personal diving into the world synchronization 

[todo] (almost everything so far :) )

Library will consist of lock-free building blocks:
- Hazard Pointer (regular)
- HP with Reference Count
- HP (Pass-the-buck version)
- RCU

And basic stuctures:
- Treiber Stack
- Michael-Scott Queue
- Lock-free HashMap
- Lock-free SkipList
- Parking Lot
- Sequence Lock
